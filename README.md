# sigmoid-neuron



A sigmoid neuron implimentation in python to understand the basic building block of ANN.

Sigmoid Neuron — Building Block of Deep Neural Networks.

The building block of the deep neural networks is called the sigmoid neuron. Sigmoid neurons are similar to perceptrons, but they are slightly modified such that the output from the sigmoid neuron is much smoother than the step functional output from perceptron.

It is much smoother than the step function. In the sigmoid neuron, a small change in the input only causes a small change in the output as opposed to the stepped output. There are many functions with the characteristic of an “S” shaped curve known as sigmoid functions. The most commonly used function is the logistic function.
